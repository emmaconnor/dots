# dots
A turing-complete programming language with only one symbol: "."

## Usage

`python dots.py <source-file>`

## Advantages

- Turing complete! Write any program you can think of!
- Commenting your code is easy since all characters other than '.' are ignored!
- Debugging is easy! There are only two possible causes of errors: too many or too few dots.
- Only requires one working keyboard key to program with.

## Examples

A sample `cat` program is provided that will copy stdin to stdout until it reads a 0 byte. This program is composed of precisely 43453 dots.

We would provide a "Hello World" program but unfortunately it's approximately 6.5x10<sup>71</sup> yottabytes.
